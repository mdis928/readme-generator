# README-Generator

Please see util folder for index.JS, markdown.js, npm package "inquirer", and example readme that gets generated.

When you are in the correct repository type in node index.js, a list of questions will appear. When you finish answering all of them, the readme file will generate the styling and populate your answers.

This current readme that you are reading is just an introduction. The readme example that gets generated includes a Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

In order to test, please make sure you install VS code, git bash, inquirer (npm package), and node JS installed.

Please make sure you have the screencastify chrome extension downloaded so that you can watch the demo.

Please reach out to mdis928 (github user), if you have any questions.
