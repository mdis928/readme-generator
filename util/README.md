https://github.com/mdis928/Team Profile Generator
## Description
The goal of the project was to do three main things. First we needed to create classes using a constructor function. Second we needed to test our classes. This is make sure the value that we put in our objects is valid. Finally we needed to write code in our index.js file so that when we enter the terminal we can choose manager, engineer, or intern and then that data gets generated in a html file
